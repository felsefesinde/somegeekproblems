*Note for GitHub Developers*
_This is a problem prepared by me for IEEE Bilkent Student Branch "Code-IT or Leave It!" Warmup Round 2022. This was the Problem A, and this repository is prepared to make other developers fork the problem and contribute to the repository by enhancing the approaches to the problem to bring out much better solutions. Eveyone is allowed to derive new problems by forking these problems from IEEE Bilkent Code-IT or Leave It Challenge!_

# **Introduction**
Two Bilkenters, Cenk and Buse (Names do not have any relationship with real people :D), decide to compete with each other to decide who is the real "The Smartest Student" of their department since half of their department agree on Cenk and the other half believes that it's Buse! Therefore, they meet at EEE building, and challenge each other about who takes an integral more quickly! Then, Cenk and Buse share their competition method with other students, so that they also duel with each other. Now let's see what kind of a Geek Problem they have about this challenge...

# **Problem Description**
The duel has several rules as described below:
* They compete in terms of sets, and the person who wins 3 (three) sets in total wins.
* To win 1 (one) set, somebody has to reach the score of 5 (five) in a single set.
* Please keep in mind that all the duels must have a winner, and there is no chance of a draw.

# **Input and Output**
1. The first line of the Input has a number N < 100, which represents the number of duels between different students.
2. The next N lines have a string for which the names of the winners of a single round in a set are given, seperated by a single space " ". Remember that the names of the competitors can be anything, just like in the example given below. [But the names of the winners can be anything! In the sample case it was "B" and "C", but it can also be "Mehmet" and "Halime", so please think accordingly]
3. Your output should include N lines with the name of the overall winner of each duel.
*An example Input/Output case is shown at the very end of this document:*

Each name seperated by a single space, " ", represents the winner of a single round. *If the format is still unclear to you, please check the sample case below.*
# **Example Case**
Please see the image below to understand the rules of the duel, and give us N lines of output, who are the best Geeks of Bilkent!

# Hint
Just like we discussed it on our face-to-face competition, do it in the simple way! So, if you were a competitor on Tuesday, this means that you are lucky because you have already seen the answer :)
