# somegeekproblems
This is a problem prepared by me for IEEE Bilkent Student Branch "Code-IT or Leave It!" Warmup Round 2022. This was the Problem A, and this repository is prepared to make other developers fork the problem and contribute to the repository by enhancing the approaches to the problem to bring out much better solutions. Eveyone is allowed to derive new problems by forking these problems from IEEE Bilkent Code-IT or Leave It Challenge!
